# Web & Mobile II - Final Project (recovered)

For my final project in my Web & Mobile class, I created a website that highlights the beauty of Costa Rica and its culture. I worked to analyze the problem, 
design, and code necessary to meet the needs of potential travelers interested in knowing more about the provinces of Costa Rica and interacting with other 
travelers, hosts, and businesses. 

* Used wireframing tools to design an enticing user interface for the target audience, as well as finding a general font and color palette to enhance the user experience 
* Centered on dynamic and modular webpages rather than static webpages to maximize functionality and versatility. Created scripting elements that greatly reinforces the interactivity of the website
* Using version control software, continuously modified pieces of the project to improve the UI and UX and produce an interactive and functional website that promotes the Costa Rica experience
